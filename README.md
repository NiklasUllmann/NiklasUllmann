## My biggest Projects:

### :fire: FIRE Technology (2020 - today):

- A free and public API to inform the German citizens about a high risk of forest fires and preventing forest fires caused by negligence
- It uses official data and provides a nice and easy way to access the data anywhere
- **10k+** daily unique API calls
- [WBS API](http://wbs.niklas-ullmann.de/ "WBS API")

### :mortar_board: My Bachelorthesis (2021):
- **Using Attention Techniques for Explainability of Deep Learning Models in Computer Vision**
- My bachelor thesis presents a novel explainer for attention-based vision transformer, which visualizes and explains the results of image classification tasks. The results are measured by quantitative metrics and compared against the established LIME explainer. Although the attention-based explainer performed slightly worse, further fine-tuning can address the identified issues. Overall, this work contributes to enhancing comprehensibility and trust in AI models by combining attention mechanisms with model explanations.

NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages i have the most code on github
