## My biggest Projects:

###  üî• FIRE Technology (2020 - today):
- Successful initiative for digital forest fire prevention in Germany
- A free and public API to inform the German citizens about a high risk of forest fires and preventing forest fires caused by negligence
- It uses official data and provides a nice and easy way to access the data anywhere
- **10k+** daily unique API calls
- [WBS API](http://wbs.niklas-ullmann.de/ "WBS API")

###  üéì My Bachelorthesis (2021):
- **Using Attention Techniques for Explainability of Deep Learning Models in Computer Vision**
- My bachelor thesis presents a novel explainer for attention-based vision transformer, which visualizes and explains the results of image classification tasks. The results are measured by quantitative metrics and compared against the established LIME explainer. Although the attention-based explainer performed slightly worse, further fine-tuning can address the identified issues. Overall, this work contributes to enhancing comprehensibility and trust in AI models by combining attention mechanisms with model explanations.

### üç¨ Sweetli - Synthetic Data Generation for Education Institutions (2023):
- Realistic synthetic data for educational and scientific purposes - generated by five students.
During the last four months, we have addressed the challenge faced by educational institutions to acquire dependable datasets suitable for academic lectures and research projects. To achieve this, we developed algorithms that can generate such datasets. Crucially, these datasets incorporate discernible patterns, offering prospects for diverse and sophisticated research inquiries that cater to diverse subject areas and maintain current relevance. Our project creates master and transaction data for a online shop of a fictitious candy manufacturer, using actual statistical distributions and an Agent-based Modelling simulation in which products and advertisements influence customers to place orders. Our solution can generate any number of data over a self-selected period. The generated data contains more than 45 individual patterns, which students and experts can analyze through visualizations and modern statistical methods from machine learning. For example, the cough drops are more popular in winter than in summer. 
- In conclusion, our project was a major success in terms of planning, implementation, and results. Furthermore, we solved relevant/practical problems with modern technologies and are pleased to hand over our project to the Nordakademie for use in lectures and research.

###  üéì My Masterthesis (2023):
- **Identifying Ultimate BeneÔ¨Åcial Ownership from Complex Corporate Structures using Graph Machine Learning**
- My master's thesis introduces an innovative graph machine learning methodology designed to identify ultimate beneficial owners within complex corporate structures. This research holds profound significance for regulatory authorities relying on such analytics to combat illegal activities like money laundering and tax evasion. The model is quantitatively evaluated and compared to the established algorithm across various general and problem-specific metrics. While the trained model demonstrated marginally inferior performance in identifying ultimate beneficial owners, its true strength emerged in addressing key challenges inherent to the algorithmic approach. It exhibited significantly improved runtime efficiency when dealing with deep and complex corporate structures. Moreover, it excelled in scenarios where the algorithm failed to yield any solution. In summary, the findings of my thesis represent a substantial step forward in the analysis of complex corporate ownership structures, offering a more efficient approach. This research enhances the effectiveness of regulatory efforts and promotes transparency within the corporate landscape.
